			                My Name is DeMarcus Tolbert and here are a few things about me that you  don't know. My  name is DeMarcus Tolbert and I am 16 years old. The first  school that I attended was the YMCA Pre K Program.I also went to W.J. Scott Elementary school. While at  Scott Elem I had a passion for performing  arts. I join many different clubs like the Boy Scouts, art, drama, debate, band, and orchestra. I love cooking and helping others.I am a scholar at The Best Academy 6-12 and a scholar of Smash.But if it wasn't for a lady who work hard grinding all day trying to make sure her family is safe and fine,then there would not be a me or a DeMarcus Tolbert of the Smith and Tolbert family and the Bradford family.   <br>
			                
			              <br> I have many different identities to classify myself like I am a photographers, I am a peom writer ,I am a Black man
				      I am a brother,Most importantly I am a Son of a Queen.
				I look more like my mom than my dad. I have one older brother on my mom's side. I  have a lot of brothers and sisters on my dads side and I am his 10 out of 16 child.My nickname used to be Forest Gump and Popeyes  because I have big eyes plus I liked to run. I can relate to the movie " Big Momma's House " because when I was young I used to jump off the bunk bed  and dressers in my room. I used to bump my head all the time. My mom said I was a super active child that always like destroying her property.     </p>
